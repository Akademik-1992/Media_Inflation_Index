# Media_Inflation_Index
The purpose of the research was to develop methodological approaches to assessing the inflationary background in information materials of Russian state news agencies with a focus on the possibility of their application in the process of modeling the consumer price index. The methodological basis was made up of methods for parsing html sites, natural language processing (NLP), deep neural network architecture, and regression algorithms. Processing 147 thousand news articles by using a pre-trained neural network from Microsoft made it possible to select 3.5 thousand news about inflation and prices, dividing them into "proinflationary" and "disinflationary". To form training and test samples, a connection to the GigaChat neural network is implemented. The inflation tonality of the marked news was simulated by by additional training (fine-tuning) of neural networks based on the BERT architecture, pre-trained in Russian. As a result, we have the inflation background index contained in the Russian media publications, with high accuracy describing the "shock" events in the economy.
